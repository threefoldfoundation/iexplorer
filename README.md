# iexplorer

A [tfchain][tfchain] explorer indexing all content from the blockchain.

## Warning

This is only a R&D project on the side.

In order to explore the blockchain you can use the official explorers: <http://explorer.threefoldtoken.com> for the standard network and <http://explorer.testnet.threefoldtoken.com> for the test network.

Should you look for a local [tfchain][tfchain] explorer which stores everything in a local KV storage, you can take a look (and use) the rexplorer project at <https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/rexplorer>. It stores wallets (including its locked outputs and optionally partial unlocked outputs), as well as some global stats in a Redis Database. It is not an official product yet, but is well tested and used by its maintainers.
